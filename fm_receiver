# FM Broadcast Receiver using USRP

## Project Overview
This project implements a **FM broadcast receiver** in the 88–108 MHz band using a **USRP B200/B210**.
The goal was to understand the complete RF reception chain, from antenna and RF front-end to baseband processing and audio output.

This project was carried out as a **self-training exercise**, proposed by a colleague, to gain hands-on experience with Software Defined Radio (SDR).

## Hardware Setup
- **SDR Platform:** USRP B200/B210
- **Antenna:** Marconi antenna
- **Frequency Band:** FM broadcast band (~100 MHz, local stations)
- **Measurement Equipment:** RF lab instruments (VNA used to observe local frequency peaks)

---

## Software & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **SDR Frameworks:**
  - Python-based SDR processing
  - GNU Radio (tested, but not used in final implementation due to UHD library issues)
- **USRP Driver:** UHD

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a classical FM receiver architecture:

1. RF signal captured by antenna
2. Downconversion using USRP RF front-end
3. Baseband signal processing in Python
4. FM demodulation
5. Audio output

A real-time spectrum observation was used to identify active FM broadcast frequencies in the local area.

---

## Results
- Successful reception and decoding of FM broadcast signals
- Audio output clearly audible
- RF spectrum observed in real time
- Practical validation of antenna and RF front-end behavior

This project demonstrated the feasibility of real-time FM reception using SDR and external RF hardware.

---

## Limitations & Observations
- Exact center frequency and bandwidth were not logged
- GNU Radio was tested but encountered UHD-related issues
- No quantitative RF performance metrics were measured (SNR, sensitivity)

These aspects are planned for future improvements.

---

## Future Improvements
- Precise frequency and bandwidth documentation
- RF measurements using VNA and spectrum analyzer
- Antenna characterization (S11)
- Comparison between simulation and real RF behavior
- Integration with other SDR applications

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of SDR concepts
- Hands-on experience with USRP hardware
- Interaction between antenna, RF front-end, and baseband processing
- Debugging of real SDR software and driver issues
